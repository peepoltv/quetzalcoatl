============

For the temporary "dev server".
The Peepol.tv landing page (redesign) is living there until I completely finish it.
Will soft launch at the Peepol.tv domain shortly and will periodically replace after updates within this repository.

**Production Stack:**

Terminal - Compass (compiles .scss into .css) - Coda 2 - GitHub for Mac

**Notes/Warnings/Rules:**

Please do not touch the Sass or Stylesheets directories without first asking Chris. They are synched to Compass for compiling.
